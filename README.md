## Title of the Project
Fortitude Detection and Elimination of Backdoor attacks and Illicit Data Breaching using Machine Learning

## About
 The Clustering and Centroids Analysis Universal Defence (CCA-UD), a novel method designed to bolster security measures within Deep Neural Network (DNN) models against potential backdoor intrusions. Through a comprehensive result discussion and performance analysis, the abstract highlights the method's efficacy in defense and adaptability across diverse scenarios. CCA-UD employs density-based clustering to identify and eliminate potential vulnerabilities within the training dataset, showcasing an attack-agnostic approach that detects backdoor threats, regardless of the specific attack type. Experimental trials reveal the method's consistency and superiority over existing defenses in neutralizing various backdoor intrusions, demonstrating its reliability and adaptability to different triggering signals Fortitude Detection and Elimination of Backdoor Attacks and Illicit Data Breaching Using Machine Learning represents a sophisticated approach focused on identifying and eradicating backdoor attacks and the unauthorized breach of data through the utilization of machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Backdoor attacks using CCA-UD.
